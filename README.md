# In house hosting possibilities.

There is a huge choice of project management tools outhere. If we remove proprietary platforms that we need to install in the cloud, remaining choices are way less important. In the open source world we have : 
- Taiga : https://tree.taiga.io (very new and still in beta version)
- Redmine : http://www.redmine.org/
- OpenProject : https://www.openproject.org/ (fork of chiliProject which is a fork of Redmine)
- Phabricator : http://phabricator.org/ (developers centric)
- Trac : http://trac.edgewall.org/
- Libre plan : http://demo.libreplan.org/ (important learning curve for non technical users.)
- ]project-open[ : http://project-open.net/ (want to be everything from ERP, CRM to PM tool)

In the proprietary world :
- Github : https://github.com/ (developers centric)
- JIRA : https://fr.atlassian.com/software/jira.html (same feature as redmine)
- twprojec : http://twproject.com/  (same spirit than jira)
- Agilefant : http://agilefant.com/ (ressource heavy : need tomcat and other java based software)

# Redmine

Redmine features that are nice to have :
- can be extend with plugins
- workflow tuning
- a user can be part of different groups and those user or groups can have permissions per project.
- gantt chart (quite basic in the out-of-the-box redmine install but way better with some plugins)
- can create subproject
- Agile and Kanban (with some plugins)

Redmine main drawback compare to JIRA is a plugin might work well under a specific version of redmine but nothing work in the next version. Under redmine 2.5, the plugins I installed work perfectly and everything work smoothly without and lag or whatsoever.

Redmine is a very powerfull tool, however redmine developers are not designer and the default theme don't look modern at all.

# Installation Cookbook on ubuntu server

## note for ubuntu
- ubuntu package for redmine is very old. We will use Redmine 2.5
- the main theme is based on minimap with some customization. Because the tool was supposed to be used by a wide range of people within the organization, I wanted a nice touch and feel because if it is dirty, no one will use it on a everyday basis.

## install


## A note on plugin install and uninstall
Plugin installation may alter you database. Uninstall a plugin would require to remove the table the plugin created. However, it did not work with some plugins I tried.

Backing up the database is important before installation something so that we can properly revert the platform if the plugin don't fit our needs.
